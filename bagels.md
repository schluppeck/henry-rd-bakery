# Bagels

![](.gitbook/assets/bagels.JPG)

### Ingredients

makes 10; you'll also need a big saucepan with boiling water

* 500g strong white flour
* 12g \(2 tsp\) salt
* 275g lukewarm water
* 6g fresh yeast \(or 3g, 1 tsp dried yeast\)
* 1 tbsp of white wine or rice vinegar
* a dash of olive oil for kneading the dough
* 2-3 l of boiling water. Add 2 tbsp of brown sugar

### Method

#### Make the dough

1. Weigh out the dry ingredients individually 
2. Mix up in a large bowl
3. In a separate container dissolve fresh / dry yeast in water and add vinegar
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ones
5. Mix until you have combined ingredients to a dough
6. Leave for 10 minutes
7. Either knead the dough for 10s on a lightly oiled worktop \(or fold dough in on itself a dozen times in the bowl\). Cover.
8. Wait for 10 minutes and repeat step 7
9. Repeat the kneading, resting cycle two more times at 10 minute intervals.

#### Let dough rise, shape, rest

1. Let the \(covered\) dough rise for 1h
2. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and shape into balls
3. Rest the dough for 15-20 minutes
4. Shape into bagels by poking a hole in the middle and pulling the dough outwards

#### Pre-heat oven, prepare to boil bagels

1. Preheat oven to 220ÂºC \(Gas mark 7\)
2. Heat 2-3l of water \(with the brown sugar added\) for scalding the bagels
3. Working in batches of 2-3, drop bagels into boiling water and wait for them to rise to the surface 
4. When the bagels float to the surface, wait for 30-60s, then flip them over and boil for 30-60s more.
5. Lay bagels out on an oiled baking tray and sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame \(or "everything"\)
6. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown

### Notes

Which are better: H&H bagels \(NYC\) or the stuff from the Brick Lane Bagel Bakery?

Quite a dry, stiff dough, so take a break and let the dough relax if it gets too hard to work.

Apparently _Short and Sweet_ by _****_Dan Lepard has some variations of this bagel recipe.
