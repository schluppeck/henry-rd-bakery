# Ciabatta

![](.gitbook/assets/ciabatta.jpg)

### 

### Ingredients

* 500g strong white flour \(Shipton Mill has Ciabatta flour\)
* 10g salt
* 400g water
* 6g of fresh yeast \(or half the amount of dried\)
* a splash of olive oil

### Baker's percentages

Weights of each ingredient relative to flour \(standard\) 

* strong white flour
* 2% salt
* 80% water
* 1.2% fresh yeast
* 5% olive oil 

### Method

1. bla bla bla
2. then bla bla bla
3. 
### Notes

The quantities are for a batch of 3-4 small loaves. If you have lot's of bread eaters in the house or are expecting guests, double or triple the quantities. When the dough rises it develops lots of big bubbles and can take up quite a bit of space. \(For 3x the basic recipe quantities, it will fill a big plastic cake carrier \(5 litre capacity\). 

Surprising fact: ciabatta was only invented in 1982 \([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciabatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciabatta)\)
